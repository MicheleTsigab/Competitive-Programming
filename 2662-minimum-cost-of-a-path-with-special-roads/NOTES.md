Dijkstra
after removing costy roads i.e cost is greater than |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|.
there are three cases to add to the min_heap(cost), i.e
1. current pos is start of a specialRoad so add current cost so far + cost to go from the specialroad start to end of it. to the heap
2. current pos to start of any starting road so add current cost + |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1
3. current pos  to our target. current cost + |target2 - x1| + |target2 - y1|
